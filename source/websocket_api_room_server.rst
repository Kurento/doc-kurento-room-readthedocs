%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
WebSocket API for Room Server
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Kurento room server exposes a Websocket at http://localhost:8080/room, where
the hostname and port depend on the current setup. The WebSocket enables the
Kurento room app to instantly push events to the clients, as soon as they
happen.

The exchanged messages between server and clients are
`JSON-RPC 2.0 <http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification>`_ requests and responses.
The events are sent from the server in the same way as a server's request, but
without requiring a response and they don't include an identifier.

WebSocket messages
==================

1 - Join room
-------------

Represents a client's request to join a room. If the room
does not exist, it is created. To obtain the available rooms, the client should
previously use the REST method getAllRooms.

- **Method**: joinRoom

- **Parameters**:

  - **user** - user's name
  - **room** -  room's name

- **Example request**::

    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"joinRoom",
     "params":{"user":"USER1","room":"ROOM_1"},"id":0}

- **Server response (result)**:

   - **sessionId** - id of the WebSocket session between the browser and
     the server
   - **value** - list of existing users in this room, empty when the room
     is a fresh one:

     - **id** - an already existing user's name
     - **streams** - list of stream identifiers that the other
       participant has opened to connect with the room. As only webcam is
       supported, will always be ``[{"id":"webcam"}]``.

- **Example response**::


      {"id":0,"result":{"value":[{"id":"USER0","streams":[{"id":"webcam"}]}],
      "sessionId":"dv41ks9hj761rndhcc8nd8cj8q"},"jsonrpc":"2.0"}

2 - Participant joined event
----------------------------

Event sent by server to all other participants in the room as a result of a new
user joining in.

- **Method**: participantJoined

- **Parameters**:

  - **id:** the new participant's id (username)

- **Example message**::

	 {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"participantJoined","params":{"id":"USER1"}}

3 - Publish video
-----------------

Represents a client's request to start streaming her local media to anyone
inside  the room. The user can use the SDP answer from the response to display
her local media after having passed through the KMS server (as opposed or
besides using just the local stream), and thus check what other users in the
room are receiving from her stream. The loopback can be enabled using the
corresponding parameter.

- **Method**: publishVideo

- **Parameters**:

  - **sdpOffer**: SDP offer sent by this client
  - **doLoopback**: boolean enabling media loopback

- **Example request**::

	{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"publishVideo","params":{"sdpOffer":
        "v=0....apt=100\r\n"},"doLoopback":false,"id":1}

- **Server response (result)**

  - **sessionId:** id of the WebSocket session
  - **sdpAnswer:** SDP answer build by the the user's server WebRTC endpoint

- **Example response**::

   {"id":1,"result":{"sdpAnswer":"v=0....apt=100\r\n",
   "sessionId":"dv41ks9hj761rndhcc8nd8cj8q"},"jsonrpc":"2.0"}

4 - Participant published event
-------------------------------

Event sent by server to all other participants in the room as a result of a user
publishing her local media stream.

- **Method**: participantPublished

- **Parameters**:

    to connect with the room. As only webcam is supported, will always be
    ``[{"id":"webcam"}]``.
