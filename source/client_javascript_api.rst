Client JavaScript API
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The developer of room applications can use this API when implementing the web interface.

It is a JavaScript library build upon other public APIs like :term:`Kurento Utils` JS, 
Kurento :term:`JSON-RPC` Client JS, EventEmitter, etc. This module can be added as a 
:term:`Maven` dependency to projects implementing the client-side code for web browsers 
that support :term:`WebRTC`.

The library is contained by the JavaScript file ``KurentoRoom.js`` from the 
module ``kurento-room-client-js``. 

The main classes of this library are the following:

 - **KurentoRoom**: main class that initializes the room and the local stream, 
   also used to communicate with the server
 - **KurentoRoom.Room**: the room abstraction, provides access to local and 
   remote participants and their streams
 - **KurentoRoom.Participant**: a peer (local or remote) in the room
 - **KurentoRoom.Stream**: wrapper for media streams published in the room

KurentoRoom
===========

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    var kurento = KurentoRoom(wsUri, function (error, kurento) {...});

Through this initialization function, we indicate the :term:`WebSocket` URI that will be 
used to send and receive messages from the server.

The result of opening the WebSocket connection is announced through a callback 
that is passed as parameter. The callback's signature also includes as parameter 
a reference to the own ``KurentoRoom`` object, giving access to its API when the 
connection was established successfully.

The interface of ``KurentoRoom`` includes the creation of the Room and of the 
local stream and also, for convenience, the following:

- Disconnect an active participant, be it remote or local media. This method 
  allows to unsubscribe from receiving media from another peer or to end publishing 
  the local media:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

     kurento.disconnectParticipant(stream);

- Close the connection to the server and release all resources:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

     kurento.close();

- Send messages to the other peers:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

     kurento.sendMessage(room, user, message);

- Send a custom request whose parameters and response handling is left to the 
  developer. In the demo application it is used to toggle the hat filter.

.. sourcecode:: javascript

     kurento.sendCustomRequest(params, function (error, response) {...});

- Add additional parameters to all WebSocket requests sent to server.

.. sourcecode:: javascript

     kurento.setRpcParams(params);

KurentoRoom.Room
================

Example:
   
.. sourcecode:: javascript
   
    var room = kurento.Room(options);

This constructor requires a parameter which consists of the following attributes:

- **room**: mandatory, the name of the room
- **user**: mandatory, the name of the peer inside the room
- **subscribeToStreams**: optional, can be true (default value) or false. If false, 
  the user won't get automatic subscription to the published streams, but will 
  have to explicitly subscribe in order to receive media.

connect() method
----------------
The room interface's main component is the connect method:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    room.connect();

Instead of using a callback for dealing with the result of this operation, the 
client must subscribe to events emitted by the room:

room-connected event
--------------------

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    room.addEventListener("room-connected", function (data) {...});

- **data.participants**: array of existing KurentoRoom.Participant
- **data.streams**: array of existing KurentoRoom.Stream

Emitted in case the join room operation was successful.

error-room event
----------------

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    room.addEventListener("error-room", function (data) {...});

- **data.error**: the error object (use data.error.message for the description)

When an error occurred when trying to register into the room.


Other events emitted during the lifecycle of the room:

room-closed event
-----------------

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    room.addEventListener("room-closed", function (data) {...}

- **data.room**: the room's name

Emitted as a result of a server notification that the room has been forcibly 
closed. Receiving this event is advised to be followed by an orderly exit from 
the room (alert the user and close all resources associated with the room).

participant-joined event
------------------------

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    room.addEventListener("participant-joined", function (data) {...});

- **data.participant**: a new KurentoRoom.Participant

Announces that a new peer has just joined the room.

participant-left event
----------------------

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    room.addEventListener("participant-left", function (data) {...});

- **data.participant**: the KurentoRoom.Participant instance

Announces that a peer has left the room.

participant-evicted event
-------------------------

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    room.addEventListener("participant-evicted", function (data) {...});

- **data.localParticipant**: the local KurentoRoom.Participant instance

Announces that this peer has to leave the room as requested by the application.

participant-published event
---------------------------

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    room.addEventListener("participant-published", function (data) {...});

- **data.participant**: the KurentoRoom.Participant instance

Emitted when a publisher announces the availability of her media stream.

stream-published event
----------------------

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    room.addEventListener("stream-published", function(data) {...});

- **data.stream**: the local KurentoRoom.Stream instance

Sent after the local media has been published to the room.

stream-subscribed event
-----------------------

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    room.addEventListener("stream-subscribed", function(data) {...});

- **data.stream**: the subscribed to KurentoRoom.Stream instance

Event that informs on the success of the subscribe operation.

stream-added event
------------------

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    room.addEventListener("stream-added", function(data) {...});

- **data.stream**: the new KurentoRoom.Stream instance

When the room automatically added and subscribed to a published stream.

stream-removed event
--------------------

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    room.addEventListener("stream-removed", function(data) {...});

- **data.stream**: the disposed KurentoRoom.Stream instance

A consequence of a peer disconnecting from the room or unpublishing their media.

error-media event
-----------------

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    room.addEventListener("error-media", function (data) {...});

- **data.error**: the error message

The server is notifying of an exception in the media server. The application 
should inform the user about the error and, in most cases, should proceed with 
an orderly exit from the room.

newMessage event
----------------

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    room.addEventListener("newMessage", function (data) {...});

- **data.room**: the room in which the message was sent
- **data.user**: the sender
- **data.message**: the text message

Upon reception of a message from a peer in the room (the sender is also notified 
using this event).

KurentoRoom.Participant
=======================

This is more of an internal data structure (the client shouldn't create instances 
of this type), used to group distinct media streams from the same room peer. 
Currently the room server only supports one stream per user.

It is a component in the data object for several emitted room events (
``room-connected``, ``participant-joined``, ``participant-left``, 
``participant-published``).

KurentoRoom.Stream
==================

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    var localStream = kurento.Stream(room, options);

The initialization of the local stream requires the following parameters:

   - **room**: mandatory, the KurentoRoom.Room instance
   - **options**: required object whose attributes are optional

      - **participant**: to whom belongs the stream
      - **id**: stream identifier (if null, will use the String webcam)

init method
-----------

The stream interface's main component is the init method, which will trigger a 
request towards the user to grant access to the local camera and microphone:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    localStream.init();

Instead of using a callback for dealing with the result of this operation, the 
client must subscribe to events emitted by the stream:

access-accepted event
---------------------

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    localStream.addEventListener("access-accepted", function () {...});

Emitted in case the user grants access to the camera and microphone.

access-denied event
-------------------

Example:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    localStream.addEventListener("access-denied", function () {...});

Sent when the user denies access to her camera and microphone.

getID() method
--------------

The identifier of the stream, usually ``webcam``.

getGlobalID() method
--------------------

Calculates a global identifier by mixing the owner's id (the participant name) 
and the local id. E.g. ``user1_webcam``.

There are several other methods exposed by the ``Stream`` interface, they will 
be described in the tutorial for making a room application.
