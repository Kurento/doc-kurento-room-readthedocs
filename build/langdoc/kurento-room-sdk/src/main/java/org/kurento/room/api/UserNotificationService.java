 * This specification was designed so that the room manager could send notifications or responses
 * back to the remote peers whilst remaining isolated from the transport or communications layers.
 * The notification API will be used by the default implementation of
 * {@link NotificationRoomHandler} (provided by the room SDK -
 * {@link DefaultNotificationRoomHandler}).
 * <p/>
 * JSON-RPC messages specification was used to define the following primitives.It is expected but
 * not required for the client-server communications to use this protocol. It is left for the
 * integrator to provide an implementation for this API. If the developer chooses another mechanism
 * to communicate with the client, they will have to use their own implementation of
 * NotificationRoomHandler which will completly decouple the communication details from the room
 * API.
